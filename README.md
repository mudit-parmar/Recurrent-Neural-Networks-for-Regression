# Recurrent-Neural-Networks-for-Regression
Dataset for stock price prediction for 5 years with one sample per day (q2_dataset.py). Create a Recurrent Neural Network using the machine learning platform of your choice (PyTorch, Tensorflow, or Keras) to predict the next day opening price using the past 3 days Open, High, and Low prices and volume. Therefore, each sample will have (4*3 = ) 12 features
